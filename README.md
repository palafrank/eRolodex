# eRolodex

eRolodex is a full stack hybrid mobile application for maintaining contact information about someone in a realtime, social manner. This is a project I am developing to teach myself Javascript, NodeJS, Bootstrap, AngularJS framework and Ionic framework. The application is targeted to run on IOS and Android using the Ionic and Cordova in the frontend and a NodeJS server at the backend with a MongoDB database serving the datastore requirements. 

The entries in the "Rolodex" is a shared link to the user and does not need to be updated manually. Each user simply creates different profiles that they would like to share with different people. A profile is then used as a request to another user to exchange contact information. If the other person accepts the invitation, they would reply with a profile of their own and from that point on, each user can see the other persons shared profile in their directory as if they had exchanged visiting cards and placed it in their rolodex.

Any updates made to any profile by the profile owner will be visible to everybody based on the sharing of the profiles. No manual update of the profiles is need by the people who have recevied the profile through invitation or sharing.
